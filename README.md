# day-planner

This is a simple work-day calendar application. It can be used to keep track of what needs to get done during the day and whether or not the time block said event needed to be done in has passed.
This application allows the user to select time blocks and input the activity needed to be done. Pressing the save button associated with the time block will save the input in that block
to local storage so the user can bring up the page with their saved data even after closing the page. The time blocks are also color coded to respresent whether the time block
is in the past, present, or future. Past time blocks are colored gray, the present time block is colored red, and future time blocks are colored green. 

## Usage

There is no installation required! All you need to do is go to kyle074613.github.io/day-planner. After you go to that page, the entire application will be available to you!
